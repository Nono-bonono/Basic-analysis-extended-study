# Basic-analysis-extended-study
An extended study challenge at the end of module 2, course 2 in Data Analytics at the LSE. Importing two data sets and preforming basic analysis on the gold and oil options.

The purpose of the challenge was to test basic data wrangling and analysis using pandas and python.
Most of the challenges were easy although it was interesting to try 2 different methods of slicing the data down to 500 rows.
